## Previewing Changes Locally

Run the following command at the root of your documentation where `mint.json` is located. Mintlify will open at `localhost:3000`.

```bash Terminal
mintlify dev
```

## Troubleshooting

Here's how to solve some common problems when working with the CLI.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Mintlify is not loading">
    Update to Node v18 and the latest version of Git.

  <Accordion
    title="Mintlify is not loading after updating Node and Git"
  >
    Run `mintlify install` and try again.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
    title="Port 3000 is already taken"
  >
    The Mintlify CLI will automatically move to the next port if you were already running something at `localhost:3000`. For example, if you were running two documentation sites, they would be at `localhost:3000` and `localhost:3001`.
