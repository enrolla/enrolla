## What are features?

A feature can describe any property of a customer you may wish to keep track:

- An _entitlement_, like which product features are enabled for a customer.
- A _configuration_, which can be any customer specific setting (e.g. a color scheme, cloud provider. etc.).

**Each `feature` includes:**
| | |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Key** | The name of the feature. (it must be a unique string, with no whitespace) |
| **Type** | One of the following: `string`, `integer` , `float` , `boolean` , `JSON`. Once set, this value cannot be changed. |  
| **Default Value** | The value that this feature will be set to for all customers unless otherwise overridden. |
| **Description** | Free text to help you identify the feature. |

<Note>An Enrolla feature is, in the simplest terms, a *key value pair*.</Note>

## Creating a Feature

Features are created in the [Features](https://app.enrolla.io/features) section of the Enrolla dashboard.

Simply provide all the required information.

**Example:**

In this example we are creating a feature called `number_of_seats`.
It's type is `integer` and its default value is `5`.

## Packages

Packages allow you to group together sets of features and define their default values.

They are explained in detail in the [Packages](/concepts/packages) section.

## Features and Customers

Feature values can be overriden at the customer level as well. This means that you can assign a different value to any feature for a specific customer, if you so choose.

More on this in the [Customers](/concepts/customers) section.

## Feature Evaluation

Once you have created a feature, you can use it in your code to evaluate the value of the feature for a specific customer.

To evaluate a feature for a particular customer, you must provide the customer's `organization_id` as well as the feature `key` to the Enrolla SDK.

This is done using the [Enrolla SDK](/sdk/introduction).
