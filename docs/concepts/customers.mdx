## What are customers?
Customers are, as the name suggests, the customers of your organization. Each must have a unique identifier, can be assigned a package, specific feature values, and secrets.

**Each `customer` includes:**
|     Name           |          Description                                                                          |
|---------------    |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| __Name__           | Free text to help you identify the customer.                                         |
| __Organization Id__          | Your organization's unique identifier for this customer.                         |  
| __Package__          | The package assigned to this customer. (Can be blank, meaning no package is assigned)   |  
| __Configuration__ | A list of all features and their values for the customer.                                    | 
| __Secrets__        | A list of all secrets and their values defined for the customer.                               |

In your production environment, you will want to evaluate *feature* and *secret* values for a particular customer, by providing the unique `organization_id` that you use to identify the customer.

So lets see how customers are created, updated, and how you can access their data.

### Integrating with your Authentication Provider

Each customer must have a unique `organization_id` that you use to identify the customer.

<Info>
This is made easier by integrating Enrolla with your authentication provider, so that this identifier is synced between systems.

We highly recommend integrating Enrolla with your authentication provider.
</Info>

See the section on [Authentication Providers](/integrations/authentication-providers/general) under [Integrations](/integrations/general) for more information.

## Creating a Customer

Customers can be created either through the [Enrolla Dashboard](dashboard/introduction), or the [Enrolla SDK](sdk/introduction).

**OrganizationId**:

When creating a customer, you can provide the unique `organization_id` that you use to identify the customer.
Alternatively, if you have connected your authentication provider, you can choose from a list of your existing customers (UI feature only) and Enrolla will automatically sync the `organization_id` for you.

<Info>This is the same identifier that you must supply the Enrolls SDK to evaluate the feature value for a particular customer.</Info>

**Package**:

When creating a new customer can choose a package to which the customer belongs.

The customer will inherit all feature values from that package by default. If no package is chosen then the customer will inherit each feature's default value as you defined them.

The following pertains both for customer creation, and updates to existing customers:

## Customer Features

<Info>
    You have the option to override the default values for any feature, for a particular customer.
    This is useful if you want to assign a unique value to a particular customer.
</Info>

Feature evaluation is always performed in the following order:
1. **Customer** - if you defined a value for the specific customer, it takes precedence.
2. **Package** - If (1) does not apply, and the customer is assigned to a package, then the package default value is used.
3. **Feature** - If both (1) and (2) do not apply, then the feature default value is used.

In the Customers section of the Enrolla Dashboard, you can see the final configuration for each customer.

See the [Features](concepts/features) section for more information.

#### Evaluating Features

To evaluate a feature for a particular customer, you must provide the customer's `organization_id` as well as the feature `key` to the Enrolla SDK.

This differs slightly language by language. See the [SDK](sdk/introduction) section for more information on its usage.

## Customer Secrets

Secrets have no default values, and must be defined for each customer.

You can define secret values for your customers through the Dashboard or the SDK.

<Note>
    You cannot view the values of previously defined secrets in the Enrolla Dashboard!
    
    This is intentional and due to the fact that without your private key, the secret values remain encrypted and cannot be shown.
</Note>

See the [Secrets](concepts/secrets) section for more information.

#### Evaluating Secrets

To evaluate a secret you must provide the customer's `organization_id` as well as the secret `key` to the Enrolla SDK.
In addition, you must provide your `privateKey` to the SDK's `initialize` method.

The SDK will then decrypt the secret value for you and return the decrypted secret.

More on this in the [Secrets](concepts/secrets) section.
