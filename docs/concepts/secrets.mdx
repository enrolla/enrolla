<Info>
  Secrets, unlike features, do not have default values and are not included in
  packages. Instead, secret values are defined per customer.
</Info>

Secrets are used to store sensitive customer information such as API keys, passwords, and other data that you want to keep private.

## Using Secrets

### Prerequisite - Create a Key Pair

Before using secrets, you must create an asymmetric key pair. This is done in the [Management UI](https://app.enrolla.io/settings/encryption-keys). Only one key pair can be created per Enrolla account.

An assymetric key pair includes 2 keys:
| Key | Description |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Public Key** | Used to _encrypt_ secrets. (Does not need to be kept safe. Stored in Enrolla for encryption in the UI) |
| **Private Key** | Used to _decrypt_ secrets. Must be kept secret and securely stored by you! |

You must supply the private key to the `initalize` function of the Enrolla SDK in order to secrets.

<Warning>
You must securly store your private key!

If you lose your private key, you will not be able to decrypt secrets. Also, please be aware that anyone with your private key will be able to decrypt your secrets, so keep it safe.

</Warning>

### Creating a Secret

Secret values are set, per customer, in the the Customer section of the Management UI. Alternatively, you can update a customer's secret value using the Enrolla SDK.

Prior to setting a secret's value, you must first create the secret key in the Management UI if it does not already exist.

### Retrieving a Secret

Secret values can be retrieved using the Enrolla SDK.

See the [SDK documentation](sdk/introduction) in your language of choice for more information.

## Security

Enrolla uses **assymetric encryption** to securely store your customers' secrets.

This means that, once encoded (with your public key), the secret can only be decoded using your private key (which is known only to you).

Enrolla **does not store your private key**, and therefore cannot decrypt secrets. (It also means that, if you lose your private key, you will not be able to decrypt secrets either)

<Note>
*This in an important concept to understand.*

Enrolla does not store your private key and therefore **does not have access to your secrets**

</Note>

Enrolla uses the [NaCL Networking and Cryptography](https://nacl.cr.yp.to/) library to encrypt and decrypt secrets, specifically the x25519-xsalsa20-poly1305 algorithm. In JavaScript/NodeJS this is implemented using the [TweetNaCl.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tweetnacl) library which has been well-audited and recommended for use by cybersecurity firm Cure53.

Secrets are encrypted in the browser (when editing values in the Management UI) or your application backend (when updating secret values using the Enrolla SDK). The _encrypted secret_ is then sent over the wire to the Enrolla servers where its stored. When you want to get a secret value in the SDK, the encrypted data is fetched from the server and, only in your application, is the secret decrypted using your private key (via the SDK).
