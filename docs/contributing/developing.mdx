Enrolla is using a monorepo (powered by [Nx Workspaces](https://nx.dev/)) with multiple apps and libraries.

It's backend is based on [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), and its front-end is React running on [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) with [Refine app](https://refine.dev/).

Follow these instructions to set up a local developement environment.

1. Clone the repositoriy and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/enrolla/enrolla.git
   cd enrolla
   nvm install
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up a local Postgres Database. You can use [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/) for Mac for example.

3. Download [doppler](https://www.doppler.com/), our secrets manager. You can access our secrets with the following service tokens:

   ```bash
   export DOPPLER_FRONTEND=dp.st.dev.jVAVymS6QD0flaTJf3ZHgDP3WECZdCfE4Zk8gjRR1cq
   export DOPPLER_BACKEND=dp.st.dev.wApQ3g6vcE2BlkL2mbPSOvxx3jWuCHgbykuTWcdeUFH
   ```

4. Apply database migrations:

   ```bash
   doppler run --token=$DOPPLER_BACKEND -- npx nx run prisma-models:prisma-deploy
   ```

5. To start developing, run the `serve` target on both the backend and the frontend:

   ```bash
   # This will serve the Backend in development mode
   doppler run --token=$DOPPLER_BACKEND -- npx nx serve
   # This will serve the Frontend in development mode
   doppler run --token=$DOPPLER_FRONTEND -- npx nx serve mgmt-ui
   ```

That's it, you are good to go! Happy hacking! ðŸ‘¾
