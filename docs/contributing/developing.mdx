Enrolla is using a monorepo (powered by [Nx Workspaces](https://nx.dev/)) with multiple apps and libraries.

It's backend is based on [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), and its front-end is React running on [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) with [Refine app](https://refine.dev/).

Follow these instructions to set up a local developement environment.

1. Clone the repositoriy and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/enrolla/enrolla.git
   cd enrolla
   nvm install
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up a local Postgres Database. You can use [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/) for Mac for example.

3. Set environment variables:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Then, edit the `.env` file and set the `DATABASE_URL` variable to your local database.

4. Apply database migrations:

   ```bash
   npx nx run prisma-models:prisma-deploy
   ```

5. To start developing, run the `serve` target on both the backend and the frontend:

   ```bash
   # This will serve the Backend in development mode
   npx nx serve
   # This will serve the Frontend in development mode
   npx nx serve mgmt-ui
   ```

That's it, you are good to go! Happy hacking! ðŸ‘¾
