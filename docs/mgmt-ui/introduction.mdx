Access the Management UI at `app.enrolla.io` and log in with your credentials.

## Authentication

Log in with your company email and Enrolla will automatically recognize users with the same email domain.

You choose whether to allow them access automatically, or via invite only.

## Features

Features are the basic buildings blocks on which you can later create packages, and overrides for customers.

Each `feature` includes:
- A`key` to uniquly identify the feature.
- A `type` from one of the following: `string`, `integer`, `float`, `boolean`, `JSON`.
- A `description` to help you identify the feature.
- A `default value`.

## Packages

Packages allow you to group together sets of features and override their default values.

Packages may also inherit from one another so that when a parent changes, so do all packages which inherit from it.

## Customers

Here you define the values for all features for an individual customer.

When creating a customer, you must provide the unique `organization id` that you use to identify the customer. 
This can be made easier via an integration with your authentication provider.

<Info>This is the same identifer that you must supply the Enrolls SDK to evaluate the feature value for a particular cutomer.</Info>

When creating a new customer you must choose a package to which the customer belongs.
The customer will inherit all feature values from that package by default.

<Note>Here that you can also override any package defaults, to make customizations unique to this customer.</Note>
