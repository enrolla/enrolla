## Why Enrolla?

Managing customer configurations takes much work. At first, it seems like just creating another SQL database, but in reality, it's just the beginning.

You need to define different pricing tiers for different customers, but some important ones require extra customization. You need to store lots of different values for them - throttling configurations, secrets, and just plain JSONs. And you need to be able to access these configurations across your system - with 0 latency. 

You also need this data synchronized across many systems - CRMs, authentication services, billing systems, and even sometimes your Databases.

Enrolla's goal is to simplify customer configuration management and provide developers with the tools to focus on delivering best-in-class products - while providing the needed flexibility for the rest of the company.
