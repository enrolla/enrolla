title: 'Authentication Providers'
---

Enrolla requires that each of your customers have a unique `organization_id`. This is the identifier that you use internally, in your organization, by which you identify the customer (a unique string, usually some kind of uuid).

While you may define this identifier yourselves, its commonplace to use a dedicated third party service, an authentication provider, to handle this for you.
If you use an external authentication provider then this guide is meant for you.

### Integration Features

- Import your existing customers into Enrolla.
- Select from your existing customer base when creating a new customer in the Enrolla Dashboard.
