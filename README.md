# ⭐️ Why Enrolla?

Every SaaS company reaches this point. It needs a way to manage customers, divide them into tiers, define which features are enabled for whom, set seat limits or measure usage.
We’ve all been there. And as engineers we just developed this internally. Again. And again.

Sure, it looks simple at first. But as the company grows, more requirements keep piling up.
There needs to be a backoffice UI for sales and support teams to use.
We want to update the “enterprise” tier to include the new SSO integration. But it only needs to apply to new customers; old customers should have the enterprise tier without SSO. And then it happens 3 more times with 3 other new features.
We need to synchronize everything with Salesforce; and the billing system.
You get the point.

So we built it as an open source project, and now you can stop doing that and focus instead on delivering your amazing product to your customers.
